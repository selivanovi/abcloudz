Task:
You should create an application with SplashScreen and MainScreen. MainScreen should contain an ImageView in the center of the screen and TextView on the top.
Configure gradle build so you have two build flavors: abcloudz and customer and two build types: debug and release.
All variants should have “com.abcloudz” in applicationId.
Builds with customer flavor also should have “.customer” suffix added to their applicationId.
All debug build variants should have suffix “.debug” added to their applicationId and have launcher icon marked with “debug” label.(icon resources you can choose yourself)
Builds with abcloudz flavor shoud have application name “ABCloudzApp-Test”.
Builds with customer flavor should have application name “ABCloudzApp-Customer”.
The ImageView from the MainActivity for debug and release builds should contain different images (it should be implemented via gradle source sets. resources you can choose yourself)
The TextView from the MainActivity for debug and release builds should contain different text - "debug title" and "release title" (it should be implemented via gradle variables)
For debug version SplashScreen should be shown for 1 second
For release version SplashScreen should be shown for a 3 seconds and with progress bar in the center (it should be implemented via gradle source sets and different packages)

It should be possible to install all build variants on the same phone simultaneously.
